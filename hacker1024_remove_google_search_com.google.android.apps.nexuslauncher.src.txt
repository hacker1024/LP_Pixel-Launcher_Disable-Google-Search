Pixel Launcher - Disable Google Search by hacker1024

Disables Google Search in the Pixel Launcher, and searches for only apps.
Tested on Pixel Experience / Android 11.

This copy of the patch uses offsets instead of binary searching.
It's intended to be used as documentation; use the binary search patch instead.

The offsets are targeted at the Pixel Launcher that ships with Android 11 Pixel Experience:

// Patch an implementation of startSearch in com.android.systemui.plugins.shared.LauncherOverlayManager.
// This method returns true if the search launch was successful, and false if it wasn't.
// It's used in multiple places where a fallback UI will display if it fails.
// The method contains some sort of check after logging a "startSearch" string, and returns false if it fails.
// The check looks something like this: if (j.r < 6 || (iLauncherOverlay = jVar.j) == null) return false;
// Replace the check with NOPs so the return code is executed, instead of a jump to the rest of the method.

// Patch AllAppsQsbLayout's search method.
// The search method calls "nexusLauncherActivity.mOverlayManager.startSearch", and shows a fallback app search UI if it returns false.
// Replace the invocation with NOPs and always show the fallback UI.
// This patch isn't required if the patch that makes startSearch return false applies successfully.

// Patch AllAppsQsbLayout's search method.
// At the beginning of the method, a check is made to determine whether the app drawer is open or not.
// If the app drawer is not open, an additional method will be called to open the search overlay.
// While this additional method also calls and checks the result of the startSearch method discussed above,
// it uses an intent to show a different search overlay as a fallback instead of falling back to the app drawer fallback UI.
// Ignore the result of the check whether the app drawer is open or not, and act like it is to show the fallback search UI.
